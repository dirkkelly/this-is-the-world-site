  There are many ways to analyse the current state of the world. However, one aspect stands out as the most influentual, the economic state. What work you do, what you eat, what recreational activites are available, how safe are you day to day. All this is determined by where you fit into the global economic system. What's more you may be suprised to hear that you probabably don't understand this system nor how your day job fits into the greater process.

  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TL;DR" target="_blank">TL;DR</a> - The global system has become amazing at harvesting the surplus generated by the large majority of poor and vulnerable people. You (likely) directly support this exploitation in your day job, in fact this is the primary reason for the quality of life you enjoy. You are not well off and people in poor countries not well off due to democracy, it is simply the current system requires a large number of poor countries with cheap labor and a small number of wealthy countries with well educated people. Note however, that the majority of the wealth generated by this process goes not to you, but to the ultra rich and is why despite modern technology we are not moving towards everyone having an abundance.
